  The Sales Performance Dashboard provides insights into the quota attainment of
  sales representatives on a daily basis. It integrates data from the
  'people_pulse_plan' to track each representativeâ€™s progress towards their
  daily quota and the 'sales_rep' view to provide contextual details about the
  sales representatives, including their personal information, regional
  assignment, and overall performance metrics. Key fields include the sales
  representative's ID, name, email, assigned region, quota metrics, hire date,
  and their daily quota attainment.

  The Sales Performance Dashboard integrates daily quota attainment data with
  sales representative details. Leverage the 'people_pulse_plan' to monitor
  daily progress towards quotas, and use 'sales_rep' for contextual information
  including names, emails, regions, and overall performance metrics. Focus on
  SALES_REP_ID to track individual performance across both views.
